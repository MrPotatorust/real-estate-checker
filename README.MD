-SQL but through an ORM

1. This project will scrape popular real estate websites in Slovakia and upload the data to a database.  
2. After that it will remove the duplicates (same properties on multiple sites).  
3. It will use skicit-learn to predict the future prices in each city and each sites and show an indicator similar to buy/sell on brokerage sites.  
4. It will save compare the prices to prices from the history to the predicted prices and recommend if and which properties you should buy.  
5. You will be able to add cities and properties to your watchlist and you will get notifications if something changes.  
6. It will also show the best deals in slovakia and in the cities you search.  

I hope I will finish this project, even if you dont see any pushes in the last few days I can be just taking a break or developing a new feature.
